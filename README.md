The Personal Assistant Macro Maker(PAMM) is a desktop program that allows users to teach their computer how to perform custom tasks
which can then be performed at any time through verbal commands. PAMM is able to record user actions such as clicking and typing and
store those actions into a macro which the user can then name as any english phrase. Users can then run PAMM in the background where it will
listen to the user's voice requests and perform requested macros.
